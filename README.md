M5 Stick as intervalometer for Canon DSLR 

Its made for bulb mode, so release is triggered twice. Code works so far tough quick and dirty, timer triggers exact exposure time, but there are still several issues with it. Unfortunately cam does not expose correctly, there are always 0.1-0.2 seconds missing. Have to further investigate that issue.
